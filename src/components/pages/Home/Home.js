            We were founded in the year 406 by Darek Dawnbreaker, Stabitha Christie, Tink Wildwander and Professor Orzanin,<br/>
            following their lucrative capture of the Dwarven bandit chief Hulil Lutan.<br/> 
            The Warsong Order is a private military company offering protection, investigation, policing, <br/>
            and other services across the entire planet of Amurru to any level of client, private or otherwise. <br/>
            <br/>
            Though starting off small, our initial operations were such a resounding success that various monarchies <br/>
            and governing bodies across the globe began to solicit our services regularly, leading to the grand and powerful <br/>
            institution that the Order is today. We now enjoy a vast amount of global influence, <br/>
            but strongly disavow any political or moral alignment other than those held by each individual member. <br/>
            <br/>
            Our grand centre of operations resides on the continent of Talâ€™Dorei, in the city of Emon. <br/>
            The main hall extends into four separate forks collected in groups of three, named after the four cardinal directions. <br/>
            The North, East, South and West Forks all cater to different needs and house varying facilities. <br/>
            These forks are better know as The Barracks, The Shadow Sect, The Hunt, and The Arcana Academy respectively.
